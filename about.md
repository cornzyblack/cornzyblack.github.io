Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my website.

My name is Eniwoke (E-knee-woe-keh), but most people call me Eni (Any) and I am a Data Engineer living in the United Kingdom.

I have worked as a Data Scientist in the Fintech space, and taught Kids programming.

I am interested in building Software, and getting involved in Machine Learning and its applications.

Like most Data folks, I write mainly in Python, but can do some JS and Java.
